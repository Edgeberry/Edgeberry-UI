To build your React project and download the build folder in a tarball from GitHub, you can use GitHub Actions to automate the build process and create a tarball artifact. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Set up GitHub Actions: Create a workflow file (e.g., build.yml) in the .github/workflows directory of your GitHub repository. This file will define the build process using GitHub Actions.

Define Workflow Steps: Define the steps for the workflow to build your React project and create a tarball artifact. Here's an example workflow:

yaml
Copy code
name: Build and Package

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      - name: Create tarball
        run: tar -zcvf build.tar.gz build
